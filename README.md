## Overview

This package aims to provide a seamless experience for users working
with CSVW metadata in data analysis environments using pandas, nbdev,
and dvc. It includes a CsvwManager class that handles loading, saving,
and applying CSVW metadata to pandas DataFrames while integrating with
nbdev for development and dvc for version control.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

``` sh
pip install csvw_pandas_integration
```

## How to use

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use CsvwManager to load a DataFrame
from a CSV file and its corresponding CSVW metadata file:

``` python
from your_project.csvw_manager import CsvwManager

# Initialize CsvwManager with paths to data and metadata files
csvw_manager = CsvwManager(csv_file='data.csv', metadata_file='data.csv-metadata.json')

# Load data from CSV file and apply CSVW metadata
df = csvw_manager.load_dataframe()

# Perform data analysis and transformations using pandas
# ...

# Save changes to the DataFrame and metadata, versioned with dvc
csvw_manager.save_dataframe(df)
```

## Features

- Loading and saving DataFrames with CSVW metadata
- Applying CSVW metadata to pandas DataFrames
- Generating and validating CSVW metadata
- Integrating with nbdev for development and dvc for version control
